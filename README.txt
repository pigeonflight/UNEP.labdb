Introduction
============
This provides a lab content type and a search interface for locating labs

We also included a dependency on eea.facetednavigation. Installing UNEP.labdb will also install eea.facetednavigation.

Adding Faceted Navigation
-------------------------
Go the "labs" folder and use the "actions" menu to activate faceted navigation. Once it is active you'll see a "faceted criteria" menu, select it and then click "import" and upload the lab-faceted-nav.xml file, a copy of it is distributed with this code or get a copy at https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pigeonflight/079885c15ee3355d6a68/raw/2b813fc4b1b2b36856b1925f8d291c74a9c093d8

After installing the xml file you can feel free to do further customizations to the code.
